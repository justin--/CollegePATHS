		"second": "College PATHS works with ninth and tenth grade students throughout their J. A. Garfield High School careers to achieve admission into a 4-year college or university. Our program revolves around four intensive Saturday academies, which introduce students to relevant social justice issues and help demystify the college application process. Students selected to participate are paired with mentors that have graduated from a 4-year college or university and are familiar with the East Los Angeles community. We are committed to teaching our students the skills required to achieve their goals, and to increase access and equity within higher education."

		"Inspiration": "California is home to the largest number of Latinos in the United States, and they have become the largest ethnic/racial group in California. Despite these numbers, Latinos are less likely to have a college degree than any other group in the state. While two-thirds graduate high school, only one-third complete the requirements making them eligible to directly apply to four-year colleges and universities. A severe lack of opportunity, support, and guidance is jeopardizing the future of those within this underrepresented community, especially undocumented youth.",
