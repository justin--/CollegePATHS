A pesar de estos números, los latinos son menos propensos a obtener un título universitario que cualquier otro grupo en el estado. Mientras que dos tercios se graduan de la escuela secundaria, sólo un tercio completan los requisitos que los hacen elegibles para aplicar directamente a las universidades. Una grave falta de oportunidades, apoyo y orientación está poniendo en peligro el futuro de aquellos dentro de esta comunidad subrepresentada, especialmente los jóvenes indocumentados.",
